# Project-Owntweet-A-Stylish-Project-List-Builder


This project is a dynamic and visually appealing web page that showcases a list of projects. It uses HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS), and PHP to create a modern and responsive layout, with the project data loaded from a separate PHP file.

## Features

-   **Dynamic Project Listing:** Project data (title, description, tags, links) are stored in `projects_data.php` and loaded dynamically into `index.php` using PHP.
-   **Stylish Design:**
    -   Uses a dark radial gradient background for a modern feel.
    -   Project cards have a subtle glow effect on hover.
    -   Uses a neon-style gradient for the heading.
    -   Cards have a transform effect on hover for a more dynamic look.
    -  Uses `Poppins` font
    - Uses `boxicons`
-   **Device-Friendly Layout:** Responsive grid layout that adapts well to different screen sizes.
-   **Multiple Link Options:** Supports GitHub links, live demo links (using a website icon), and general website URLs (using a world icon) for projects.
-   **Tag-Based Organization:** Projects are tagged, making it easier to categorize projects based on technology or type.
-   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Uses CDN links for external resources (Tailwind CSS, Boxicons, Google Fonts) for faster load times.
-   **PHP Templating:** Uses PHP to dynamically generate the HTML and for data management.
